# Loan Advisory Bot

An interactive agentic ai model designed to provide users with personalized loan advice using OpenAI-powered language models.


## Features & Flow

1. **Backend API (Python/FastAPI)**  
   - Users interact via `frontend` or curl to `/chat` endpoint.  
   - Incoming prompts are routed to OpenAIClient or Gemini services.  
   - Conversations stored using PostgreSQL via Alembic migrations.  
   - Loan Q&A dataset enhances responses.  

2. **Frontend Chat UI (React)**  
   - Interactive chat interface, consuming `/chat` backend.  
   - Displays responses and handles loading/error states.

3. **Database & Data Migration**  
   - PostgreSQL storage setup via Docker Compose.  
   - Alembic handles schema migrations and version control.

4. **Environment Management**  
   - `.env` holds sensitive keys and connection strings.  
   - `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates backend, frontend, and postgres services.
